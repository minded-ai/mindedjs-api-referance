# Introduction

Welcome to Minded Docs ðŸ‘‹

Minded is an AI agent development platform designed for rapidly building, deploying, and scaling production-grade agents.

It brings developers, product teams, and business users together to accelerate AI agent creation by up to 10x.

- **Generate with AI**: Prompt Copilot, our AI assistant, to quickly generate sophisticated AI agents. Copilot seamlessly integrates with your existing systems, APIs, and workflows, ensuring every agent is production-ready from the start.
- **Build Visually**: Easily refine agents and workflows with our intuitive visual editor. Drag-and-drop to create, configure, and test your agents without writing code.
- **Extend with Code**: Customize and extend agents by editing code directly. Enjoy two-way synchronization with GitHub, so your changes stay seamlessly integrated across visual and code-based workflows.
- **Manage Centrally**: Control and manage your agents with built-in governance, including granular access controls, version control, audit logs, and comprehensive monitoringâ€”all accessible from a single unified platform.

Let's dive in and start building powerful AI agents with Minded!

## ðŸš€ Get Started

Ready to build your first AI agent? Start with our [Quick Start Guide](getting-started/quick-start.md) to create a working agent in minutes.

### What You'll Learn

1. [**Installation**](getting-started/installation.md) - Set up MindedJS in your project
2. [**Quick Start**](getting-started/quick-start.md) - Build your first refund processing agent
3. [**Core Concepts**](low-code-editor/flows.md) - Understand flows, nodes, edges, and memory
4. [**Your First Eval**](resources/your-first-eval.md) - Solve your first eval

### Key Concepts

- [**Flows**](low-code-editor/flows.md) - Directed graphs of nodes connected by edges
- [**Nodes**](low-code-editor/nodes.md) - Processing units (triggers, prompts, tools, junctions)
- [**Edges**](low-code-editor/edges.md) - Routing logic between nodes
- [**Tools**](low-code-editor/tools.md) - Strongly-typed functions for LLMs to call
- [**Memory**](platform/memory.md) - Type-safe state management across your flow
