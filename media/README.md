# Introduction

Compose, run, and extend AI-first agents with a few lines of code.

***

## âœ¨ Why MindedJS?

*   **SDK with no-code platform** â€“ Define Agent as Code or use the visual no-code editor on top.&#x20;

* **Declarative flows** â€“ Define complex, multi-step conversational flows.
* **Type-safe tooling** â€“ Tools & events are fully typed, giving you autocomplete and compile-time safety.
* **Language-model agnostic** â€“ Bring your own LLM model (OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq, â€¦).
* **Local-first** â€“ Run fully in-memory for development and testing.
* **Out of the box Integrations** - plug into 2000+ apps with a single click

## ðŸš€ Get Started

Ready to build your first AI agent? Start with our [Quick Start Guide](getting-started/quick-start.md) to create a working agent in minutes.

### What You'll Learn

1. [**Installation**](getting-started/installation.md) - Set up MindedJS in your project
2. [**Quick Start**](getting-started/quick-start.md) - Build your first refund processing agent
3. [**Core Concepts**](core-concepts/flows.md) - Understand flows, nodes, edges, and memory

### Key Concepts

* [**Flows**](core-concepts/flows.md) - Directed graphs of nodes connected by edges
* [**Nodes**](core-concepts/nodes.md) - Processing units (triggers, prompts, tools, junctions)
* [**Edges**](core-concepts/edges.md) - Routing logic between nodes
* [**Tools**](core-concepts/tools.md) - Strongly-typed functions for LLMs to call
* [**Memory**](core-concepts/memory-types.md) - Type-safe state management across your flow
